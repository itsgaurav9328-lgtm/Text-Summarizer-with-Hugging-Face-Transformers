# Text-Summarizer-with-Hugging-Face-Transformers
A simple Python script that uses the Hugging Face transformers library to generate a concise summary of a given piece of text. This project leverages the pre-trained facebook/bart-large-cnn model, a state-of-the-art model for text summarization.

## Technologies Used 

  * **Python**
  * **Hugging Face (transformers)**: The main library used to access the pre-trained NLP model.
  * **PyTorch (torch)**: The backend framework that powers the model.
  * **Sentencepiece**: A tokenizer library required by the BART model.
